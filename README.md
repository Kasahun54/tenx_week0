# Solar Radiation Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes solar radiation data, including measurements such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and other environmental factors. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, check for anomalies, and assess correlations between the data.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:


- **`src/`**: Contains the Python source code for EDA and data processing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for performing EDA and analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for executing analyses and generating visualizations.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for ensuring code correctness.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists dependencies for the project.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
